\chapter{Evaluation}
Beside completing objectives and the project plan defined in the last section, We proposed to evaluate our approach in many parallel algorithms. For example, we will implement mergesort, Cooley-Tukey FFT or N-Body simulations. We will measure the performance against sequential implementations as well as similar algorithms in other parallel frameworks. 

Also, not only will we benchmark the performance of execution of generated code, but also we will benchmark the performance of the tool-chain; \eg measure the compile time against different input sizes. 

Finally, we will focus on measuring the quality of generated code regarding generated code size or readability. We hope we will not experience an exponential growth of code size against input data.
