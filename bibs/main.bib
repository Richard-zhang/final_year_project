  abstract = {Arrows are a general interface for computation and an alternative to Monads for API design. In contrast to Monad-based parallelism, we explore the use of Arrows for specifying generalised parallelism. Specifically, we define an Arrow-based language and implement it using multiple parallel Haskells. As each parallel computation is an Arrow, such parallel Arrows (PArrows) can be readily composed and transformed as such. To allow for more sophisticated communication schemes between computation nodes in distributed systems, we utilise the concept of Futures to wrap direct communication. To show that PArrows have similar expressive power as existing parallel languages, we implement several algorithmic skeletons and four benchmarks. Benchmarks show that our framework does not induce any notable performance overhead. We conclude that Arrows have considerable potential for composing parallel programs and for producing programs that can execute on multiple parallel language implementations.},

  abstract = {Monads have become very popular for structuring functional programs since Wadler introduced their use in 1990. In particular, libraries of combinators are often based on a monadic type. Such libraries share (in part) a common interface, from which numerous benefits flow, such as the possibility to write generic code which works together with any library. But, several interesting and useful libraries are fundamentally incompatible with the monadic interface. In this paper I propose a generalisation of monads, which I call arrows, with significantly wider applicability. The paper shows how many of the techniques of monadic programming generalise to the new setting, and gives examples to show that the greater generality is useful. In particular, three non-monadic libraries for efficient parsing, building graphical user interfaces, and programming active web pages fit naturally into the new framework.},

  abstract = {Tacit programming, also called point-free style, is a programming paradigm in which function definitions do not identify the arguments (or "points") on which they operate. Instead the definitions merely compose other functions, among which are combinators that manipulate the arguments. Tacit programming is of theoretical interest, because the strict use of composition results in programs that are well adapted for equational reasoning. It is also the natural style of certain programming languages, including APL and its derivatives, and concatenative languages such as Forth. The lack of argument naming gives point-free style a reputation of being unnecessarily obscure, hence the epithet "pointless style".UNIX scripting uses the paradigm with pipes.
For example, a sequence of operations in an applicative language such as the following Python code:

... is written in point-free style as the composition of a sequence of functions, without parameters:

The key idea in tacit programming is to assist in operating at the appropriate level of abstraction.  That is, to translate the natural transformation given by currying

  abstract = {Computing systems are becoming increasingly parallel and heterogeneous, and therefore new applications must be capable of exploiting parallelism in order to continue achieving high performance. However, targeting these emerging devices often requires using multiple disparate programming models and making decisions that can limit forward scalability. In previous work we proposed the use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) to provide high-level abstractions that enable transformations to high performance parallel code without degrading programmer productivity. In this paper we present a new end-to-end system for building, compiling, and executing DSL applications on parallel heterogeneous hardware, the Delite Compiler Framework and Runtime. The framework lifts embedded DSL applications to an intermediate representation (IR), performs generic, parallel, and domain-specific optimizations, and generates an execution graph that targets multiple heterogeneous hardware devices. Finally we present results comparing the performance of several machine learning applications written in OptiML, a DSL for machine learning that utilizes Delite, to C++ and MATLAB implementations. We find that the implicitly parallel OptiML applications achieve single-threaded performance comparable to C++ and outperform explicitly parallel MATLAB in nearly all cases.},

Applications include network protocols, business processes and operating system services. In this paper we define a multithreaded functional language with session types, which unifies, simplifies and extends previous work. There are four main contributions. First is an operational semantics with buffered channels, instead of the synchronous communication of previous work. Second, we prove that the session type of a channel gives an upper bound on the necessary size of the buffer. Third, session types are manipulated by means of the standard structures of a linear type theory, rather than by means of new forms of typing judgement. Fourth, a notion of subtyping, including the standard subtyping relation for session types (imported into the functional setting), and a novel form of subtyping between standard and linear function types, which allows the typechecker to handle linear types conveniently. Our new approach significantly simplifies session types in the functional setting, clarifies their essential features and provides a secure foundation for language developments such as polymorphism and object-orientation.},

We argue that advanced type system features, such as GADTs and type families, play a crucial role in minimising such runtime errors. Specifically, a rigorous type discipline reduces runtime errors due to bugs in both embedded language applications and the implementation of the embedded language compiler itself. In this paper, we focus on the safety guarantees achieved by type preserving compilation. We discuss the compilation pipeline of Accelerate, a high-performance array language targeting both multicore CPUs and GPUs, where we are able to preserve types from the source language down to a low-level register language in SSA form. Specifically, we demonstrate the practicability of our approach by creating a new type-safe interface to the industrialstrength LLVM compiler infrastructure, which we used to build two new Accelerate backends that show competitive runtimes on a set of benchmarks across both CPUs and GPUs.},

  title = {Verifying {{Asynchronous Interactions}} via {{Communicating Session Automata}}},
  abstract = {The relationship between communicating automata and session types is the cornerstone of many diverse theories and tools, including type checking, code generation, and runtime verification. A serious limitation of session types is that, while endpoint programs interact asynchronously, the underlying property which guarantees safety of session types is too synchronous: it requires a one-to-one synchronisation between send and receive actions. This paper proposes a sound procedure to verify properties of communicating session automata (csa), i.e., communicating automata that correspond to multiparty session types. We introduce a new asynchronous compatibility property for csa, called k-multiparty compatibility (k-mc), which is a strict superset of the synchronous multiparty compatibility proposed in the literature. It is decomposed into two bounded properties: (i) a condition called k-safety which guarantees that, within the bound, all sent messages can be received and each automaton can make a move; and (ii) a condition called k-exhaustivity which guarantees that all k-reachable send actions can be fired within the bound. We show that k-exhaustive systems soundly and completely characterise systems where each automaton behaves uniformly for any bound greater or equal to k. We show that checking k-mc is pspace-complete, but can be done efficiently over large systems by using partial order reduction techniques. We demonstrate that several examples from the literature are k-mc, but not synchronous compatible.},

  abstract = {In computer architecture, Amdahl's law (or Amdahl's argument) is a formula which gives the theoretical speedup in latency of the execution of a task at fixed workload that can be expected of a system whose resources are improved. It is named after computer scientist Gene Amdahl, and was presented at the AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference in 1967.
Amdahl's law is often used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical speedup when using multiple processors. For example, if a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular part of the program which takes one hour to execute cannot be parallelized, while the remaining 19 hours (p = 0.95) of execution time can be parallelized, then regardless of how many processors are devoted to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time cannot be less than that critical one hour. Hence, the theoretical speedup is limited to at most 20 times

  abstract = {This paper presents a code generation framework for type-safe and deadlock-free Message Passing Interface (MPI) programs. The code generation process starts with the definition of the global topology using a protocol specification language based on parameterised multiparty session types (MPST). An MPI parallel program backbone is automatically generated from the global specification. The backbone code can then be merged with the sequential code describing the application behaviour, resulting in a complete MPI program. This merging process is fully automated through the use of an aspect-oriented compilation approach. In this way, programmers only need to supply the intended communication protocol and provide sequential code to automatically obtain parallelised programs that are guaranteed free from communication mismatch, type errors or deadlocks. The code generation framework also integrates an optimisation method that overlaps communication and computation, and can derive not only representative parallel programs with common parallel patterns (such as ring and stencil), but also distributed applications from any MPST protocols. We show that our tool generates efficient and scalable MPI applications, and improves productivity of programmers. For instance, our benchmarks involving representative parallel and application-specific patterns speed up sequential execution by up to 31 times and reduce programming effort by an average of 39\%.},
