\chapter{Project plan} \label{plan}
This section is the proposed plan for the project. It is organised into milestones with the corresponding deadlines attached.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Week 5 - 6: Specification of the intermediate language.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Week 5 - Jan 31st: Define the syntax.  
    \item Week 6 - Feb 8th: Define the operation semantics
\end{enumerate}
\item Week 7 - 8: A simulator that reflects the operation semantics of the language
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Week 8 - Feb 22nd: Implement a simulator that gathers all possible traces of execution of programs
\end{enumerate}
\item Week 9: Session typing the language
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Week 9 - Mar 1st: Use session type to type check the language. There're two possible approaches
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Encode session type into the Haskell type system to type check 
        \item Write our own type checker to type check the programs
    \end{itemize} 
\end{enumerate}
\item Week 10: Translation rule 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Week 10- Mar 8th: Adapt a translation rule from a high-level language in parallel framework PAL to the language
\end{enumerate}
\item Week 11 - 18: Code generation in C
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Week 13- Mar 29th: Specify the target language constructors (a subset of C)
    \item Week 16- Apr 19th: Translation scheme to the target language
    \item Week 18- May 3rd: Refine the implementations and debug
\end{enumerate}
\item Week 19 - 23: Evaluation
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Week 20- May 17th: Implement example algorithms for benchmarking
    \item Week 22- May 31st: Benchmark the performance of the generated code
    \item Week 23- Jun 7th: Benchmark the tool-chain performance like compile time or size of generated code
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
