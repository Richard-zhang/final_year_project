@article{ngSafeMPICode,
  title = {Safe {{MPI Code Generation}} Based on {{Session Types}}},
  abstract = {This paper presents a code generation framework for type-safe and deadlock-free Message Passing Interface (MPI) programs. The code generation process starts with the definition of the global topology using a protocol specification language based on parameterised multiparty session types (MPST). An MPI parallel program backbone is automatically generated from the global specification. The backbone code can then be merged with the sequential code describing the application behaviour, resulting in a complete MPI program. This merging process is fully automated through the use of an aspect-oriented compilation approach. In this way, programmers only need to supply the intended communication protocol and provide sequential code to automatically obtain parallelised programs that are guaranteed free from communication mismatch, type errors or deadlocks. The code generation framework also integrates an optimisation method that overlaps communication and computation, and can derive not only representative parallel programs with common parallel patterns (such as ring and stencil), but also distributed applications from any MPST protocols. We show that our tool generates efficient and scalable MPI applications, and improves productivity of programmers. For instance, our benchmarks involving representative parallel and applicationspecific patterns speed up sequential execution by up to 31 times and reduce programming effort by an average of 39\%.},

  title = {Arrows for {{Parallel Computation}}},
  abstract = {Arrows are a general interface for computation and an alternative to Monads for API design. In contrast to Monad-based parallelism, we explore the use of Arrows for specifying generalised parallelism. Specifically, we define an Arrow-based language and implement it using multiple parallel Haskells. As each parallel computation is an Arrow, such parallel Arrows (PArrows) can be readily composed and transformed as such. To allow for more sophisticated communication schemes between computation nodes in distributed systems, we utilise the concept of Futures to wrap direct communication. To show that PArrows have similar expressive power as existing parallel languages, we implement several algorithmic skeletons and four benchmarks. Benchmarks show that our framework does not induce any notable performance overhead. We conclude that Arrows have considerable potential for composing parallel programs and for producing programs that can execute on multiple parallel language implementations.},

The model is monadic and has explicit granularity, but allows dynamic construction of dataflow networks that are scheduled at runtime, while remaining deterministic and pure. The implementation is based on monadic concurrency, which has until now only been used to simulate concurrency in functional languages, rather than to provide parallelism. We present the API with its semantics, and argue that parallel execution is deterministic. Furthermore, we present a complete workstealing scheduler implemented as a Haskell library, and we show that it performs at least as well as the existing parallel programming models in Haskell.},

Haskell provides various language features that can capture concurrent programming with session types, with full linearity invariants and in a mostly idiomatic style.

  abstract = {Monads have become very popular for structuring functional programs since Wadler introduced their use in 1990. In particular, libraries of combinators are often based on a monadic type. Such libraries share (in part) a common interface, from which numerous benefits flow, such as the possibility to write generic code which works together with any library. But, several interesting and useful libraries are fundamentally incompatible with the monadic interface. In this paper I propose a generalisation of monads, which I call arrows, with significantly wider applicability. The paper shows how many of the techniques of monadic programming generalise to the new setting, and gives examples to show that the greater generality is useful. In particular, three non-monadic libraries for efficient parsing, building graphical user interfaces, and programming active web pages fit naturally into the new framework.},

  abstract = {Tacit programming, also called point-free style, is a programming paradigm in which function definitions do not identify the arguments (or "points") on which they operate. Instead the definitions merely compose other functions, among which are combinators that manipulate the arguments. Tacit programming is of theoretical interest, because the strict use of composition results in programs that are well adapted for equational reasoning. It is also the natural style of certain programming languages, including APL and its derivatives, and concatenative languages such as Forth. The lack of argument naming gives point-free style a reputation of being unnecessarily obscure, hence the epithet "pointless style".UNIX scripting uses the paradigm with pipes.
For example, a sequence of operations in an applicative language such as the following Python code:

... is written in point-free style as the composition of a sequence of functions, without parameters:

The key idea in tacit programming is to assist in operating at the appropriate level of abstraction.  That is, to translate the natural transformation given by currying

  abstract = {Computing systems are becoming increasingly parallel and heterogeneous, and therefore new applications must be capable of exploiting parallelism in order to continue achieving high performance. However, targeting these emerging devices often requires using multiple disparate programming models and making decisions that can limit forward scalability. In previous work we proposed the use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) to provide high-level abstractions that enable transformations to high performance parallel code without degrading programmer productivity. In this paper we present a new end-to-end system for building, compiling, and executing DSL applications on parallel heterogeneous hardware, the Delite Compiler Framework and Runtime. The framework lifts embedded DSL applications to an intermediate representation (IR), performs generic, parallel, and domain-specific optimizations, and generates an execution graph that targets multiple heterogeneous hardware devices. Finally we present results comparing the performance of several machine learning applications written in OptiML, a DSL for machine learning that utilizes Delite, to C++ and MATLAB implementations. We find that the implicitly parallel OptiML applications achieve single-threaded performance comparable to C++ and outperform explicitly parallel MATLAB in nearly all cases.},

First is an operational semantics with buffered channels, instead of the synchronous communication of previous work. Second, we prove that the session type of a channel gives an upper bound on the necessary size of the buffer. Third, session types are manipulated by means of the standard structures of a linear type theory, rather than by means of new forms of typing judgement. Fourth, a notion of subtyping, including the standard subtyping relation for session types (imported into the functional setting), and a novel form of subtyping between standard and linear function types, which allows the typechecker to handle linear types conveniently. Our new approach significantly simplifies session types in the functional setting, clarifies their essential features and provides a secure foundation for language developments such as polymorphism and object-orientation.},
